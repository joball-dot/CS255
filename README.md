Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DrivePass project was a project where I took information from an interview and created a system design and several diagrams to go along with it. The client was DrivePass and they wanted a web based system that could be accessed from many different devices and locations. 

What did you do particularly well?

I feel like my buisness requirements document where I identified their functional and non funtional requirements and identified how important they are. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my diagrams as I feel like I could improve them greatly with more time and make them more detailed to encumpass more of the requirments and the system design. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs in a priority based list and implemented them as such. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they will be the ones that use the system the most and you want to be able to have a system that meets or exceeds the user's needs. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software as a stepped process begining with one thing at a time to focus on each level and grow them as I worked on it. I would add some additional strategies such as more research and break the system down more to focus on analyzing each step a little bit at a tiem.
